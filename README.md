# Commodity Trading Smart Contract

## Project Title
Commodity Trading Platform

## Project Description
The Commodity Trading Platform is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to trade commodities using Ethereum blockchain. The platform enables users to buy and sell commodities such as gold, oil, or agricultural products, represented as tokens in the blockchain. The smart contract manages the commodity balances, transactions, and prices, ensuring transparency and security for the users.

## Project Vision
The vision of the Commodity Trading Platform is to revolutionize the global trading of commodities by providing a decentralized, transparent, and secure system that allows users to trade commodities directly with each other. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to eliminate intermediaries, reduce transaction costs, and enable faster and more efficient commodity trading.

## Key Features
- **Buy Commodities**: Users can buy different types of commodities by paying the required price in Ether (ETH).
- **Sell Commodities**: Users can sell commodities they own and receive Ether as payment.
- **Commodity Tracking**: The contract tracks the availability and balances of each commodity.
- **Decentralized and Transparent**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.
- **Event Logging**: Every transaction (buy/sell) triggers an event that can be monitored externally.

## Future Scope
- **Support for Multiple Commodities**: The platform can be extended to include support for multiple commodities such as precious metals, energy resources, agricultural products, etc.
- **Price Fluctuation**: Implement dynamic pricing models where commodity prices can fluctuate based on demand and supply.
- **Decentralized Exchange Integration**: Integrate with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to facilitate more extensive trading opportunities.
- **Smart Contract Upgradability**: Implement a mechanism for upgrading smart contracts without losing data or disrupting the platform’s operation.
- **KYC/AML Compliance**: Integrate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) mechanisms for user verification and regulatory compliance.

### How to Use the Smart Contract
1. **Deploy the contract** on the Ethereum network using Remix or any Ethereum-compatible development framework.
2. **Add commodities** using the `addCommodity` function by specifying the commodity ID, name, price per unit (in Wei), and available units.
3. **Buy and sell commodities** through the `buyCommodity` and `sellCommodity` functions by specifying the commodity ID and units.
4. **View user balances** with the `getCommodityBalance` function and track commodity details with `getCommodityDetails`.
